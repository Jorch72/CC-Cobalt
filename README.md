# Cobalt - ComputerCraft called you back.
---
Cobalt is a wrapper for ComputerCraft that allows it to run in a callback fashion, rather than an event-based way. Cobalt aims to make ComputerCraft similar to Love2D programming.  
  
Cobalt also has downloadable packages, like **Cobalt-UI**, which adds a full UI library into your projects.
